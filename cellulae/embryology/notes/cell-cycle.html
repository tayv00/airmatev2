                    <h4>1.0 Introduction</h4>
                    <p>The cell cycle is defined as the period between successive divisions of a cell. During this period, the cell grows, synthesizes DNA and eventually divide to form daughter cells. The contents of the cell must be accurately replicated before cell division.</p>

                    <h4>2.0 Phases</h4>
                    <p>The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase.</p>
                    <p>During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the mitotic phase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides.</p>
                    <p>The first portion of the mitotic phase is called mitosis and involves karyokinesis, or nuclear division. The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells.</p>
                    
                    <h4>2.1 Interphase</h4>
                    <p>In interphase, the cell prepares for mitosis by growing and making a copy of its DNA.</p>
                    <p>The prefix inter- means between, reflecting that interphase takes place between one mitotic (M) phase and the next. It is further divided into three stages—</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Gap 1 (G<sub>1</sub>)</li>
                        <li>DNA synthesis (S)</li>
                        <li>Gap 2 (G<sub>2</sub>)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>2.1.1 G<sub>1</sub> phase (first gap)</h4>
                    <p>It is also known as the pre-synthetic phase. The cell actively grows and synthesizes RNA, proteins and organelles. This phase follows mitosis.</p>

                    <h4>2.1.2 Synthetic phase (S phase)</h4>
                    <p>The synthetic phase (S phase) follows the G<sub>1</sub> phase.
                        It is characterized by DNA replication, in which the chromosomes double their DNA proportion (but chromosome number is still diploid).
                        Duplication of centrioles also begins at this stage. Centrioles help separate DNA during the M phase.
                    </p>

                    <h4>2.1.3 G<sub>2</sub> phase (second gap)</h4>
                    <p>During the G<sub>2</sub> phase (post-DNA duplication phase) the cell grows more, makes proteins and organelles, and began to reorganize its contents in preparation for mitosis.
                        It is characterized by synthesis of tubulin (from which spindle microtubules are formed); and synthesis of non-histone proteins.
                        Repair of some damaged DNA also occurs at the G<sub>2</sub> phase (in addition to that which occurs at the G<sub>1</sub> phase).
                    </p>
                    <p>This phase is also characterized by accumulation of the maturation promoting factor (MPF).
                        This protein triggers the onset of mitosis, the condensation of the chromosomes and the disintegration of nuclear envelope.
                        G<sub>2</sub> phase ends when mitosis begins. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>2.2 Mitotic (M) phase</h4>
                    <p>During the mitotic (M) phase, the cells divide its copied DNA and cytoplasm to make two new daughter cells. It has two stages—</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Mitosis</li>
                        <li>Cytokinesis</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>During mitosis, the nuclear DNA of the cell condenses into visible chromosomes and is pulled apart by the mitotic spindle, a specialized structure made out of microtubules.  It proceeds in four phases—</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prophase</li>
                        <li>Metaphase</li>
                        <li>Anaphase</li>
                        <li>Telophase</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Some sources describes prometaphase as the second phase of mitosis following prophase and preceding metaphase but it is not always presented as a distinct part of mitosis and its events are assigned to late prophase or early metaphase.</p>
                    <p>Mitosis is enhanced by growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, erythropoietin (precursor of erythrocyte growth factor), epithelial growth factor, etc. These proteins are needed in small amounts.</p>
                    <p>In cytokinesis, the cytoplasm of the cell is split in two, making two new cells. </p>

                        <h4>Why is the cell cycle important?</h4>
                        <br>
                        <p>The study of the cell cycle has vast relevance to the health, well-being, and biology of all organisms, from the growth and development of these organisms, to cancer and aging humans, to the potential for disease and injury repair via stem cell therapies.</p>

                    <h4>3.0 Cell cycle exit and G₀ phase</h4>
                    <p>
                        What happens to the two daughter cells produced in one round of cell cycle? This depends on what type of cells they are. 
                        Some types of cells divide rapidly, and in these cases, the daughter cells may immediately undergo another round of cell division. For instance, many cell types in an early embryo divide rapidly, and so do cells in a tumor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other types of cells divide slowly or not at all. These cells may exit the G<sub>1</sub> phase and enter a resting state called G<sub>0</sub>. In G<sub>0</sub>, a cell is not actively preparing to divide, it’s just performing its function. For instance, it might conduct signals as a neuron or store carbohydrates as a liver cell. Other such cells include skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. 
                        G₀ is a permanent state for some cells, while others may re-start division if they get the right signals.
                    </p>


                    <h4>4.0 Control of the cell cycle</h4>
                    <p>An event, may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growth-promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (HGH) can trigger the initiation of the cell division. A lack of HGH can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much HGH can result in gigantism. </p>
                    <p>Another factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-to-volume ratio. The solution to this problem is to divide.
                        Whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase.
                    </p>
                    <p>To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints. A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable. </p>
                    <p>These checkpoints occur near the end of G<sub>1</sub>, at the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition, and during metaphase of mitosis. The integrity of the DNA is assessed at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint, proper chromosome duplication is assessed at the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint and attachment of each kinetochore to a spindle fiber is assessed at the M checkpoint.
                        In addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle. These regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle (negative regulation).
                    </p>

                    <h4>4.1 Positive Regulation</h4>
                    <p>Two groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are protein kinases that, when fully activated, can phosphorylate and thus activate other proteins that advance the cell cycle past a checkpoint. To become fully activated, a Cdk must bind to a cyclin protein and then be phosphorylated by another kinase.</p>
                    <p>Cyclin activity produces an important restriction point (R) late in G<sub>1</sub> and a similar G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint which are important for the maintenance of chromosome stability and cell viability.</p>
                    <p>The genes that code for positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, when mutated in certain ways, become oncogenes, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous.</p>


                    <h4>4.2 Negative Regulation</h4>
                    <p>Negative regulators halt the cell cycle. The best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein (Rb), p53, and p21. All three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged or non-functional in cells that had begun to replicate uncontrollably (became cancerous). Rb and other proteins that negatively regulate the cell cycle are sometimes called tumor suppressors.</p>


                    <h4>5.0 Applied Anatomy</h4>
                    <p>A disregulation of the cell cycle components may lead to tumor formation. When some genes like the cell cycle inhibitors, RB, p53 etc. mutate, they may cause the cell to multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor.
                        Neoplasm (tumor) is an abnormal mass of tissue formed by uncoordinated cell division. It could be benign or malignant.
                    </p>
                    <p>Benign tumor is characterized by slow growth and non-invasiveness; while malignant tumors (cancers) has a capacity for rapid growth and invasion of other tissues.
                        Increased number of mitotic figures is seen in malignant tumor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the duration of cell cycle in tumor cells is equal to or longer than that of normal cell cycle, the proportion of cells that are in active cell division (versus quiescent cells in G₀ phase) in tumors is much higher than in normal tissue. Thus there is a net increase in cell number as the number of cells that die by apoptosis or senescence remains the same.
                    </p>
